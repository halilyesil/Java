Java type conversion why?

java certification circulm.

2 requirements, they sould be compitable to conversion
secod one is new assigned value should be smaller( from smaller container to large container) these are the aotomatic conversion ones.

-they should be widening* thecnical terms must be known for the interwiews.


type casting or narrowing, its depend of our dyta, it depends on the situaiton. we could lose the dyta or sth. we should chechk it.
- Create double variabe cast to short(initialize(başlangıç durumuca getirmek) it) double myNum= 189.726

- i should be android and swift developer i guess. i have to figure out sth. i had to search lots of things. i need routines.
-


    byte number1 = 99;
    int number2 = number1;
    int number3 = 128;
    number1 = (byte) number3;
    System.out.print(number1);


        double number1 = 44.676;
    short shortNum = (short)number1;
    System.out.println(shortNum);

*/
    char myChar = 'a';
    System.out.println((int)myChar);
    int myInt = 99;
    System.out.println((char)myInt);


    //new example


    int number1 = 10;
    float number2 = 4.5f;
    System.out.println(number1*number2);







    }


}
